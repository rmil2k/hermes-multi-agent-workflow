"""TriageEngine — the one entrypoint for every DETERMINISTIC pipeline step.

Design principle: **fat engine, thin skill.** Everything that can be computed
deterministically lives here in Python (testable, version-controlled). The
orchestrator skill (`skills/templates/triage-orchestrator/SKILL.md`) is reduced
to the few steps that genuinely need a model's JUDGMENT:

    - reading an item and proposing per-dimension rubric scores
    - producing the research classification
    - writing the proposal prose

Everything else — dedup lookup, applying the scoring threshold, route resolution,
building the research fan-out, building the prep and post-gate chains, picking
workspaces — is a method here. The skill calls these; it does not re-implement
them in prose.

This module returns plain dict "task specs" (title/body/role/parents/workspace)
rather than touching the board itself, so it is unit-testable without a live DB.
`proposal_actions.py` and the orchestrator turn specs into real cards via
`KanbanStore.create_task`. See `docs/01-architecture.md`.
