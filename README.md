# Hermes Multi-Agent Workflow

A reusable skeleton for an **autonomous, multi-agent triage pipeline** built on
[Hermes](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent): a fleet of agents that
**detects** items from sources, **dedups** them, **scores** them against a rubric,
**researches** them in parallel, **routes** each to a fulfillment path, pauses at
**one human approval gate**, then **fulfills and delivers** — all coordinated on a
single Hermes Kanban board.

It ships pre-wired as a worked example (find pain points AI-agent users hit →
build a fix or make an explainer video), so you can read a complete pipeline and
then repoint it at your own domain.

> **This is a template, not a turnkey app.** It runs its unit tests and validates
> its config out of the box, but going live requires setting up your Hermes
> install, profiles, auth, and scouts (see `docs/07-runbook.md`). The point is to
> give you — and your coding agent — a clear, working structure to adapt.

## The idea

```
sources → intake → dedup → score → research (parallel) → route
                                                            │
              ┌──────────────────────┬──────────────────────┤
            path A                 path B                  shelve
           (prep)                 (prep)                  (auto)
              └──────────┬───────────┘
                   ── HUMAN GATE ──   approve · shelve · modify
              ┌──────────┴───────────┐
            fulfill                fulfill
              └──────────┬───────────┘
                      deliver
```

The shape is fixed; **what flows through it is yours.** Everything domain-specific
lives in one file, `triage.yaml`.

## Quickstart

```bash
python -m pip install -e .               # installs the hermes-triage CLI
hermes-triage validate                   # check the example config
python -m unittest discover -s tests     # 12 tests, all generic
hermes-triage scaffold --base-profile default # print setup commands using a base profile
hermes-triage scaffold --apply --base-profile default # execute setup commands
hermes-triage doctor                     # check Hermes readiness for this pipeline
hermes-triage smoke-test                 # simulate one local item lifecycle
hermes-triage item list                  # list live item records
hermes-triage item list --smoke          # list smoke-test item records
hermes-triage item show <slug>           # inspect live item frontmatter, events, body
hermes-triage item show <slug> --smoke   # inspect a smoke-test item
```

For old-style usage without installing the package, `python -m cli.triage ...`
still works. The runtime dependency is intentionally small: just PyYAML.

## Adapt it to your domain

The whole adaptation is editing `triage.yaml` + the markdown templates it points
at. Hand your coding agent **`AGENTS.md`** and ask it to walk you through
`docs/04-adapting-to-your-domain.md`. In brief:

1. Edit `triage.yaml`: sources, rubric, research lanes, route map, paths, roles.
2. Edit `paths/` templates (scope rails, deliverable specs, proposal formats).
3. Edit `skills/templates/` (scout queries + orchestrator notes).
4. `python -m cli.triage validate`, keep `tests/` green.
5. Follow `docs/07-runbook.md` to set up profiles and go live.

## Documentation

- `docs/01-architecture.md` — fat engine / thin skill; how the pieces fit.
- `docs/02-the-board.md` — Kanban as the bus; dispatcher; fan-in.
- `docs/03-config-reference.md` — every `triage.yaml` key.
- `docs/04-adapting-to-your-domain.md` — the step-by-step adaptation guide.
- `docs/05-pipeline-stages.md` — each stage, and the gotchas to preserve.
- `docs/06-security.md` — trust surface, scope rails, safe publishing.
- `docs/07-runbook.md` — profiles, board, crons, go-live.
- `examples/ai-agent-pain-points/REFERENCE.md` — full write-up of the reference
  implementation this template was extracted from.

## Security

This template runs LLM-authored code and shells out, behind one human gate. Read
**`SECURITY.md`** and `docs/06-security.md` before deploying — and run the
pre-publish secret-scan checklist before open-sourcing an adapted copy.

## Contributing

See **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**. The golden rule: keep `engine/` domain-agnostic; new
domains go in `triage.yaml`, not the code.
