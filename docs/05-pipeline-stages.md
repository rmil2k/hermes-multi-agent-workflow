# 05 — Pipeline stages (and the gotchas to preserve)

Walks one item through the pipeline, pointing at the code for each stage and
calling out the hard-won gotchas you must not regress.

## Stage 1 — Intake (scout)

A scout (cron, on a source profile) searches its surface, writes a report to
`${HERMES_PROFILE_DIR}/vault/intake/<ts>-<source>.md`, and creates one `intake`
card assigned to the orchestrator. **Scouts only detect** — no dedup/score/route.

- Code: scout skill template; `engine/intake_parser.py` parses the report.
- ⚠️ **Gotcha — kanban toolset.** Scouts run via cron, not the dispatcher, so
  kanban tools are NOT auto-enabled (`HERMES_KANBAN_TASK` is unset). Each scout
  profile must list `kanban` in `toolsets:` or it writes a report but silently
  fails to create the intake task.

## Stage 2 — Dedup (orchestrator → engine)

For each candidate, `TriageEngine.dedup(text)` ranks existing vault items.
`duplicate` → append source, stop. `possible` → flag, continue. `new` → create
the item file (`ItemVault.create_item`, `status: triage`).

- Code: `engine/dedup.py`, `engine/item_vault.py`.

## Stage 3 — Score (orchestrator judgment + engine)

The orchestrator scores each rubric dimension (using `TriageEngine.rubric_prompt()`)
and hands the breakdown to `TriageEngine.score()`, which applies maxes + threshold.
Below threshold → **auto-shelve, don't bother the human.** Write `score` /
`score_breakdown` to the item file either way.

- Code: `engine/scoring.py`.

## Stage 4 — Research fan-out (engine builds cards)

`TriageEngine.research_specs(slug, triage_id)` returns the parallel lane cards
(all parented to the triage card). The orchestrator creates them plus a single
`route` card parented to **all** lanes.

- ⚠️ **This is the fan-in pattern** — the route card auto-fires when the last lane
  finishes. No polling. See docs/02.
- ⚠️ **Gotcha — research artifacts persist.** Every research lane runs with
  `workspace_kind="dir"` pointed at `work/items/<slug>/`. Scratch workspaces are
  cleaned after completion, so evidence tables and notes would otherwise vanish.

## Stage 5 — Route (engine)

The classifier lane emits a value (`route.classifier`). `TriageEngine.route(value)`
maps it to a path name; the orchestrator writes `path: <name>` on the item. An
`auto` path (e.g. `shelve`) ends here.

- Code: `engine/routing.py`.

## Stages 6–7 — Prep + propose

`TriageEngine.prep_specs(slug, path)` builds the pre-gate chain. When it finishes,
the orchestrator drafts the proposal from `paths/proposals/<path>.md`, sets
`status: awaiting_approval`, and **sends it**.

- ⚠️ **Gotcha — prep artifacts persist.** Prep stages use the same path workspace
  convention as fulfillment (`work/<subdir>/<slug>/`) so proposal research,
  specs, and intermediate assets remain available after approval.

- ⚠️ **Gotcha — delivery ≠ status.** The orchestrator is a headless worker. It
  MUST run `hermes send --to telegram --file <proposal>`; setting the status field
  notifies no one. (The first live run of the origin system produced proposals
  that never reached the human because of exactly this.)

## Stage 8 — Human gate

The human replies (verbs from `gate:`). The orchestrator shells to
`proposal_actions.py {approve|shelve|shelve-all|modify}`.

- ⚠️ **Gotcha — no leading slash.** Telegram reserves `/commands`; `/approve` is
  intercepted. Reply `approve <slug>`.
- The gate is **non-blocking**: while waiting, the orchestrator processes other
  items.

## Stages 9–11 — Fulfill + deliver

On `approve`, `proposal_actions.py` reads `paths.<path>.fulfill` and spawns the
chain via `TriageEngine.fulfillment_specs()`.

- ⚠️ **Gotcha — persistent workspace.** Every fulfillment stage runs with
  `workspace_kind="dir"` pointed at the SAME `work/<subdir>/<slug>/` used by
  prep for that path. Scratch workspaces are wiped between tasks, which strands
  the final delivery step. The engine already does this — don't switch it to
  scratch.
- ⚠️ **Gotcha — first stage `ready`.** The first fulfillment card has no blocking
  parent so it lands `ready`; the rest chain off it. A child of the open triage
  card would sit in `todo` forever.
- The final stage delivers to the human (`hermes send`).

## Cost gate (cross-cutting)

`scripts/cost_report.py <slug>` sums per-item spend from board telemetry and
compares to `cost_gate_usd`. Over before the gate → pause + ask; over after
approval → notify + continue. Degrades to "telemetry unavailable" if your Hermes
build doesn't expose cost columns — adjust the SQL there for your schema.

## Failure handling

- Worker crash → the dispatcher reclaims/respawns per Hermes's respawn guard.
  (Higher-level "self-healing" — e.g. regenerating artifacts lost to a scratch
  dir — is orchestrator-skill behavior you write, not core Hermes.)
- Missing tool / ambiguous state → the worker should block the card with a reason,
  not guess.
- Be honest in completion metadata. Don't fake a green test.
